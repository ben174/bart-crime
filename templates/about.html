<h1 class="display-3 text-center">BART Crimes</h1>
<h2 class="text-center">Making Public Information Public</h2>
<p>
  In spite of a <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/07/11/board-directors-to-police-increase-transparency-about-crimes-on-bart/">recent initiative</a> to "increase public's access to BART crime data",
  they have in fact been <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/07/11/bart-police-chief-crime-reports-released-to-public-on-case-by-case-basis/">reducing the amount of crime information they publish</a> because of
  <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/07/26/san-francisco-transit-officials-accused-of-putting-political-correctness-above-public-safety/">fear of racial sterotyping</a>.
  While I agree with the notion that it would be a shame if racial biases are formed for any reason, I am of the firm belief that it is not BART's job to hide information from us. <b>Nor is it their right.</b>
</p>
<p>
  BART has reduced their daily crime updates to a mailing list which requires approval. The information on this site is scraped from those daily emails and posted.
</p>
<p>
  I created this site while sitting on BART for my daily commute back and forth from Fremont to San Francisco. I've seen a lot of crazy things on that commute, and I think security is in serious need of some attention. Particularly gate security.
  I'd venture to say a huge percent of the negative press BART is getting is by the same people I see hopping the fare gate every single day. Nothing is ever done about it.
</p>
<p>
  I love BART, but I've had it with the overly-aggressive begging, bodily fluids, needles, and just plain garbage I see on a daily basis.
