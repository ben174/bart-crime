Is that crazy or what?  There's zero incentive to follow the law when we tell youth that there will be zero consequences for breaking the law!\r\n\r\nThe following is the first several paragraphs from a San Francisco Chronicle article on May 7, 2017:\r\n\r\nBART is poised to spend millions of dollars to halt fare cheating, but it turns out the transit agency is largely powerless to punish gate-jumping juveniles \u2014 thanks to a new state law.\r\n\r\nUnder the law, which took effect in January, \u201cthose under 18 years of age cannot be arrested or cited for fare evasion,\u201d acting BART Police Chief Jeffrey Jennings wrote in a training bulletin to his officers on March 16.\r\n\r\nThe law, SB882 by state Sen. Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, was directed at keeping juveniles from racking up misdemeanor arrests on their records just for jumping fare gates.\r\n\r\nThe result: BART has yet to issue a single citation to a juvenile fare jumper this year.\r\n\r\nBART says fare evaders are costing the system up to $25 million a year. The mob of 40-plus juveniles who took over a train car at the Coliseum Station on April 22 and robbed the passengers committed a host of crimes \u2014 but it should be noted that they also all jumped the fare gates.\r\n\r\nBART officials insist that the new state law doesn\u2019t mean juvenile offenders are given a free pass to ride their system. Station agents and police can refuse entry to juveniles who don\u2019t have a ticket, \u201cand BART can eject juvenile fare evaders from the system,\u201d said spokesman Jim Allison.   }}}"
